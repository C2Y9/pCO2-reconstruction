## Data and data treatment
Underway sea surface pCO2 data from 35 cruises ranging from 2000-2017 were compiled in this study. Observed sea surface pCO2 in the SCS is mainly distributed on the northern shelf and in the northern basin. Since monthly data are hardly available for each year starting from 2000, we have compiled the data seasonally in which the spring season includes March-May, the summer season is June-August, the fall season is September-November, and the winter season includes December and the next January and February.
